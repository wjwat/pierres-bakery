## :computer: Technologies Used

## :memo: Description

Against his better judgement Pierre has decided to join the rest of us in the 21st century and get a website for his business. Sadly Pierre doesn't know what he wants so we've crafted a console application that does not interface with his business at all, but it sure is a lot of fun picking options and looking at it go!
